How are Vietnamese values similar or different from Australian

There are some differences and similarities between Vietnamese and Australian values.
Both Vietnamese and Australians are so friendly, humorous, and open.
They hard work and are happy to help another.
if you look closely, you can see that Australians place a high value on independence
and personal choice. In Vietnam, the parents or teacher usually show the best way that children/students should follow.
While Australians are also prepared to accept a range of opinions rather than believing there is one truth, Vietnamese believe there is one.
Another noticeable difference is that Australians believe that life should have a balance between work and leisure time, while Vietnamese just focus on what they want. One more interesting fact is that Australian notions of privacy mean that areas such as financial matters, appearance, and relationships are only discussed with close friends but Vietnamese can share it with everyone that they feel friendly.
