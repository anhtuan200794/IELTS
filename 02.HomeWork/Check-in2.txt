Write a short paragraph to describe the difficulties of living abroad

While living abroad we will meet a lot of difficulties.
Fist of all is the language, if you move to new country they use the difference language with your native language, language will be a barrie
for you to living and familar with the new life.
The 2nd one is the culture shock, it is the difference bettween the mother land culture and the new culture in the country that you move to.
Sometimes it will make you shock, hard to adapt and lose your enthusiasm.
The last one, you will need to finding new friends. I think friends are very importance for the life, they can share, help and support to make us more happy and don't feel loney in the big world.
That is all of my opinion about the difficulties of living abroad
