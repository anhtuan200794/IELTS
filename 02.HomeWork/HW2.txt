My home town is Sonla, a mountain province.
It is located in the north of VN, about 150km far from Hanoi
It has a lot of mountains, high pass, some small streams, and the Da River.
There are 5 main ethnicities in my hometown, Kinh, Thai, Muong, Dao, and H'Mong.
Most of them are farmers.
They are gentle, hardworking, and friendly.
My hometown has a lot of beautiful places that I recommend tourists to visit.
The 1st is Mocchau highland. It is a big farm with many ecotourism destinations.
It has the longest glass bridge in the world spanning 2 mountains.
You will have a lot of perfect photos if you come there.
Next is the Ta Xua with Song Khung Long (dinosaur backbone mountain) a high mountain with a wonderful view.
From there you can see all the town below and touch the cloud during the sunset and sunrise.
